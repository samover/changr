# Changr

Final project for Makers Academy. Working in an agile team we build an IOS app in **Swift**, a language none of us had any prior experience with. With this project we wanted to help the less advantaged in our society to receive donations on the fly using a location-aware app thanks to **Bluetooth Beacons**.

Using a TDD approach, we had to write [an ad-hoc mock](https://github.com/samover/FirebaseMock) for **Firebase** in Swift, which we tested using **Quick/Nimble**. Unit testing was done through **XCTest**.

The presentation video of the app can be found on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/AyVZJ511cqI?t=96)

How to install?
---------------
* Make sure you have XCode 7.2 installed
* Clone the project
* Add Carthage frameworks running `carthage bootstrap`
* Add [Paypal SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-iOS-SDK) to the project files. You probably want to import them into your project.
* Add Firebase Framework to project. Follow these [instructions](https://www.firebase.com/docs/ios/alternate-setup.html)
* Plug in your phone and build the app
