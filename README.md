# Changr

Final project for Makers Academy. Working in an agile team we built an IOS app in **Swift**, a language none of us had any prior experience with. With this project we wanted to help the less advantaged in our society to receive donations on the fly using a location-aware app thanks to **Bluetooth Beacons**.

Using a TDD approach, we had to write [an ad-hoc mock](https://github.com/samover/FirebaseMock) for **Firebase** in Swift, which we tested using **Quick/Nimble**. Unit testing was done through **XCTest**.

The presentation video of the app can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0fKhXaRQPc)
